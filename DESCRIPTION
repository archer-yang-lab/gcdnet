Description: This package implements a generalized coordinate descent (GCD)
    algorithm for computing the solution path of the hybrid Huberized support vector
    machine (HHSVM) and its generalization, including the LASSO and elastic net
    (adaptive) penalized least squares, logistic regression, HHSVM, squared hinge
    loss SVM and expectile regression.
