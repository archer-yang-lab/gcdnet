Description: Implements a generalized coordinate descent (GCD) algorithm
    for computing the solution path of the hybrid Huberized support vector
    machine (HHSVM) and its generalization, including the LASSO and elastic
    net (adaptive) penalized least squares, logistic regression, HHSVM,
    squared hinge loss SVM and expectile regression.
